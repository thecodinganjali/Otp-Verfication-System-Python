# Otp-Verfication-System-Python

## Introduction

Developing an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system in Python is the objective of this project. The system will generate a 6-digit OTP and send it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user will enter it into the system for validation. Access will be granted if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP; otherwise, access will be denied.


## Project Objectives ðŸ’¡

1) Implement a function to randomly generate a 6-digit OTP.
2) Develop a function to simulate sending the OTP to the user's email address.
3) Create a function to prompt the user to enter the OTP received in their email.
4) Implement a function to verify if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP.
5) Ensure proper error handling and user-friendly prompts throughout the system. Allow the user to retry OTP entry in case of incorrect input.
